<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite extensive investment in terminology infrastructure—including the NLM Value Set Authority Center's 1,520 clinical value sets, NCI Thesaurus's 192,000 cancer concepts, and HL7 FHIR's sophisticated terminology binding framework—scientific software development continues to rely on ad-hoc enumerations that impede data integration. We present Common Value Sets (CVS), a LinkML-based framework that bridges the gap between comprehensive terminology services and practical software engineering needs. Unlike existing systems that require runtime terminology servers (VSAC), complex reasoning infrastructure (NCIt), or healthcare-specific protocols (FHIR), CVS compiles semantically-grounded value sets directly into type-safe programming language constructs. The framework provides 322 standardized enumerations across 22 domains, each linked to established ontologies while maintaining the simplicity of native language enumerations. Through a "progressive semantic enhancement" strategy, developers can use CVS as simple enums with zero configuration, then gradually access richer semantic features as needed. Analysis of early adoption shows 60% reduction in data harmonization time compared to manual mapping and elimination of enum-related type errors in multi-service architectures. CVS demonstrates that the adoption barriers for semantic standards stem not from lack of standards but from the complexity gap between terminology services and everyday programming—a gap that compile-time generation effectively bridges.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The biomedical and scientific communities have invested billions in terminology infrastructure and clinical research data standards. The NIH alone has funded thousands of clinical studies that have greatly advanced our understanding of human health, yet these precious datasets remain largely siloed due to data heterogeneity. The National Library of Medicine's Value Set Authority Center (VSAC) maintains over 1,520 value sets for clinical quality measures. The National Cancer Institute's Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) curates 192,000 concepts in NCIt, serving as the FDA-accepted standard for oncology trials. The NIH Common Data Elements (CDE) program has promoted standardized data fields across research studies, with over 142,000 CDEs collected from multiple repositories. HL7 FHIR defines sophisticated terminology binding patterns adopted by major health systems worldwide. Yet paradoxically, most scientific software still relies on ad-hoc enumerations—strings like 'male'/'female', integers like 1/2, or abbreviated codes like 'M'/'F'—that cannot interoperate despite representing identical concepts.</p>
<p>This disconnect between terminology infrastructure and practical usage is not a failure of standards but a fundamental impedance mismatch. As noted in recent analyses of CDE repositories, the practical challenge of aligning variables across data sources remains largely unresolved, with CDEs often having different units, contexts, or types of measurement even when representing the same concept. Existing systems optimize for different concerns: VSAC for regulatory compliance with CMS quality measures, NCIt for comprehensive cancer concept modeling, FHIR for runtime terminology expansion in clinical workflows, and CDE repositories for prospective study standardization. All require substantial infrastructure—authentication systems, terminology servers, reasoning engines—that exceeds the complexity budget of typical scientific software projects. This complexity creates what we term a "semantic chasm" where the lack of binding between data elements and ontological concepts greatly hinders cross-study alignment and AI-readiness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, developers face immediate practical needs: validating user input, ensuring type safety across service boundaries, generating consistent documentation. When confronted with the choice between a string literal that works immediately and a terminology service requiring weeks of integration, developers predictably choose simplicity. The result is thousands of incompatible representations of common concepts, each trivial individually but collectively forming a major barrier to data integration.</p>
<p>Recent advances in model-driven development, particularly the Linked Data Modeling Language (LinkML), suggest a different approach: compile-time generation that preserves semantic grounding while producing native language constructs. Rather than choosing between semantic richness and practical usability, we can transform the former into the latter through code generation.</p>
<p>We present Common Value Sets (CVS), a framework that leverages LinkML to bridge the terminology-implementation gap. CVS provides semantically-grounded value sets that compile to type-safe enumerations in multiple programming languages. By treating terminology as a build-time concern rather than a runtime service, CVS enables developers to use standardized vocabularies with the same ease as native enumerations while preserving full semantic traceability to established ontologies and standards.</p>
<p>Our approach reflects a key insight from analyzing terminology adoption failures: the problem is not missing standards but mismatched abstractions. Where existing systems provide terminology services, developers need terminology artifacts. Where standards offer runtime flexibility, developers need compile-time guarantees. Where infrastructure assumes institutional deployment, developers work on laptops with intermittent connectivity. CVS addresses these mismatches through a "progressive semantic enhancement" model that provides immediate value while preserving paths to fuller semantic integration. This approach complements ongoing efforts to harmonize CDEs through AI-assisted curation and semantic mapping frameworks, providing a practical bridge between comprehensive terminology services and everyday software development needs.</p>

<h3 id="21-established-value-set-repositories-and-common-data-elements">2.1 Established Value Set Repositories and Common Data Elements</h3>
<p>The landscape of value set management systems reflects decades of investment in healthcare and biomedical terminology infrastructure. The NIH has promoted the use of Common Data Elements (CDEs)—commonly defined data fields or survey questions along with their permissible answers—to facilitate interoperability when building case report forms or data dictionaries. However, CDEs while "common" are not truly interoperable, with over 40 different CDEs existing just for capturing systolic blood pressure, each with different units, contexts, or types of measurement. The proliferation of CDE repositories and partially overlapping sets of CDEs, combined with the absence of standard schema and subsequent computability, makes it difficult to reuse existing CDEs or harmonize data across studies.</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine's Value Set Authority Center (VSAC) exemplifies the scale of these efforts, maintaining over 1,520 value sets that support electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) and clinical decision support (CDS) systems across U.S. healthcare institutions. VSAC's architecture centers on integration with the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), which provides semantic grounding through more than 200 source vocabularies. This integration enables sophisticated terminology services, including concept browsing, value set authoring with versioning workflows, and standardized access through FHIR Terminology Service APIs and the Sharing Value Sets (SVS) specification. Each value set receives a unique Object Identifier (OID) that explicitly links it to quality measures and CDS artifacts, ensuring regulatory traceability.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute's Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) takes a different approach, managing the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) with its 192,000 concepts organized across 20 hierarchies. NCIt has achieved particular prominence through FDA acceptance of its Neoplasm Core subset, which encompasses 91,000 cancer-specific concepts used in regulatory submissions. The EVS maintains 37 specialized value sets for clinical trials, directly integrated with the Cancer Data Standards Registry (caDSR). While NCIt's comprehensive coverage serves oncology research well, its OWL representation exceeds 500MB and requires description logic reasoning for full classification, presenting significant infrastructure requirements for implementation.</p>
<p>Recent analyses of CDE repositories (including caDSR, NIH CDE Repository, METEOR, MDM, CEDAR) show full compliance with only 45% of the FAIR principles for Findability and Reusability, 67% for Interoperability, and 90% for Accessibility. Violations include the absence of version control, persistent identifiers, and provenance metadata, along with missing or poorly defined term definitions and minimal use of ontologies.</p>
<p>HL7 FHIR represents the most recent evolution in terminology services, introducing a nuanced binding framework that acknowledges real-world flexibility requirements. FHIR distinguishes four binding strengths: required bindings that mandate specific codes, extensible bindings that prefer certain values while allowing justified additions, preferred bindings that recommend but don't mandate value sets, and example bindings that merely illustrate possible values. This graduated approach reflects lessons learned from decades of rigid terminology implementations that failed to accommodate edge cases and local variations. FHIR's terminology infrastructure comprises ValueSet resources for both intensional (rule-based) and extensional (enumerated) definitions, CodeSystem resources for first-class code system representation, ConceptMap resources for explicit inter-terminology mappings, and the $expand operation for dynamic value set expansion at runtime.</p>
<h3 id="22-ontology-infrastructure">2.2 Ontology Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry has established the most successful framework for coordinated ontology development in the life sciences. Founded on principles of open access, collaborative development, and orthogonality to prevent scope overlap, the OBO Foundry enforces strict quality criteria for member ontologies. These include adherence to OWL 2 format with OBO profile restrictions, persistent PURLs for identifier stability, comprehensive Dublin Core metadata annotations, and automated dashboard monitoring of over 30 quality metrics. This rigor has produced high-quality ontologies like the Gene Ontology and Cell Ontology that serve as semantic anchors for biological data.</p>
<p>However, a fundamental tension exists between ontologies and value sets. Ontologies model complete domains with formal logical relationships, while value sets typically require specific subsets tailored to particular use cases. This granularity mismatch means that using an ontology directly as a value set often provides too many irrelevant terms while potentially missing application-specific values. Additionally, OWL classification requires specialized reasoning tools that exceed the complexity budget of most software projects, and ontology evolution can invalidate downstream value sets when terms are deprecated or relationships change.</p>
<p>The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) from EMBL-EBI and BioPortal from Stanford have emerged as primary access points for biomedical ontologies. OLS indexes 251 ontologies containing 8.9 million terms, providing Solr-based search with autosuggest functionality and RESTful APIs that return JSON-LD representations. BioPortal offers even broader coverage with 1,068 ontologies, including many non-OBO sources, along with a SPARQL endpoint for complex semantic queries, an annotator service for text mining, and a recommender service that suggests appropriate ontologies for given terms. Despite these capabilities, both platforms fundamentally serve ontologies as monolithic artifacts rather than supporting the curation of application-specific value set subsets, leaving a gap between ontology infrastructure and practical value set needs.</p>
<h3 id="23-data-modeling-approaches">2.3 Data Modeling Approaches</h3>
<p>Schema.org represents perhaps the most successful vocabulary standardization effort in terms of adoption, with millions of websites using its vocabularies for structured data markup. Its success stems from a minimalist design philosophy that prioritizes simplicity over semantic precision, combined with powerful SEO incentives that reward adoption with improved search visibility. The framework supports domain-specific extensions like health-lifesci for specialized needs and provides multiple serialization syntaxes including JSON-LD, Microdata, and RDFa. However, Schema.org's focus on web content markup fundamentally limits its applicability to scientific data modeling, where it lacks both the precision required for research data and any validation mechanisms beyond basic type checking.</p>
<p>The ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registry Standard takes a more formal approach to data element management, distinguishing between conceptual domains (abstract value spaces), value domains (concrete permissible value sets), data element concepts (semantic definitions independent of representation), and comprehensive administrative metadata for stewardship and lifecycle tracking. This standard has seen implementation in systems like the Australian National Health Data Dictionary and CDC's Public Health Information Network Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (PHIN VADS). Despite its theoretical rigor, ISO 11179's abstract metamodel and complex six-part specification create significant implementation barriers, requiring substantial expertise to translate its concepts into working systems.</p>
<h3 id="24-gaps-in-current-approaches">2.4 Gaps in Current Approaches</h3>
<p>Despite substantial investment in terminology infrastructure, a consistent pattern of limitations emerges across existing systems. The fundamental challenge, as highlighted in recent CDE harmonization research, is that while CDEs are critical biomedical assets for research projects, they have yet to yield their full anticipated benefit. The practical challenge of aligning variables across data sources is still largely unresolved, creating what researchers term a "semantic despair" where fragmented and poorly interoperable clinical data lacks crucial context, limiting scientific insights and AI-readiness.</p>
<p>Domain specificity represents the most obvious constraint, with VSAC focused exclusively on clinical quality measures, NCIt optimized for cancer research, and FHIR designed for healthcare interoperability. This specialization, while enabling deep domain coverage, prevents these systems from serving the broader scientific community's needs for cross-domain value sets spanning biology, chemistry, materials science, and computational research.</p>
<p>Implementation complexity poses an equally significant barrier. Adopting VSAC requires understanding UMLS licensing, terminology service authentication, and healthcare-specific workflows. NCIt implementation demands OWL reasoning infrastructure capable of processing 500MB ontologies. FHIR terminology bindings necessitate mastery of the resource model, operations framework, and conformance rules. Even ISO 11179, designed as a general standard, requires translating abstract metamodels into concrete implementations. These complexity requirements exceed the resources available to most research projects, leading developers to create ad-hoc enumerations rather than navigate terminology infrastructure.</p>
<p>A fundamental semantic-practical gap separates rich knowledge representation from everyday programming needs. Systems like OWL and UMLS provide sophisticated semantic modeling with description logic, subsumption hierarchies, and multi-axial classifications. Yet developers typically need simple enumerations that integrate with type systems, provide IDE autocomplete, and compile to efficient code. Current systems offer no bridge between these worlds, forcing an all-or-nothing choice between semantic richness and practical usability.</p>
<p>The reliance on runtime services rather than compile-time artifacts further limits adoption. VSAC, EVS, and FHIR all assume network-accessible terminology servers that respond to dynamic queries. This architecture, while enabling real-time updates and flexible expansion, introduces operational dependencies that many projects cannot support. Research software often runs in disconnected environments, on researcher laptops, or in compute clusters without external network access.</p>
<p>Finally, the absence of native programming language support means developers must manually translate terminology concepts into code constructs. While APIs return JSON or XML representations, these must be parsed, validated, and transformed into language-specific types. This translation layer introduces opportunities for errors, prevents static type checking, and eliminates IDE support that developers expect from modern tooling. This gap is particularly problematic for achieving AI-readiness, where modern AI demands consistent, semantically aligned inputs, yet most clinical datasets remain inconsistently captured and fragmented.</p>
<p>CVS addresses these gaps through LinkML's compilation approach, which generates native language constructs from semantically-grounded schemas, providing the benefits of formal terminology management without sacrificing developer experience. By providing a bridge between comprehensive CDE repositories and practical software implementation, CVS complements emerging efforts to use AI for CDE harmonization and semantic mapping.</p>
<h2 id="3-design-principles">3. Design Principles</h2>
<p>CVS design follows several key principles derived from analysis of existing systems, user requirements, and lessons learned from CDE harmonization challenges. Recent research has identified that the need for scalable, automated solutions to address data heterogeneity complexities has never been more urgent, especially as contemporary biomedical datasets continue to grow in volume, heterogeneity, and complexity. These principles guide architectural decisions and establish clear trade-offs between competing goals.</p>
<p>The principle of semantic grounding ensures that every enumeration value links to established ontology terms where applicable, providing machine-interpretable semantics. This linkage enables automated reasoning, data validation, and cross-dataset integration while preserving human readability. Unlike systems that require full ontological commitment, CVS makes semantic grounding optional but accessible, allowing projects to benefit from semantics without mandatory complexity.</p>
<p>Developer ergonomics drive the requirement that enumerations be immediately usable in common programming languages without specialized tools or training. Generated code must provide native enum types with full IDE support, type checking, and standard library integration. This principle directly addresses the adoption barriers observed in existing terminology systems, where complex APIs and specialized tooling prevent casual usage.</p>
<p>Modular organization structures the framework through domain-specific modules that allow selective import, reducing complexity for users who need only specific vocabularies. The hierarchical organization from domain through schema to individual enumerations provides logical grouping while maintaining global uniqueness. This modularity enables projects to adopt only relevant portions of the framework without carrying unnecessary dependencies.</p>
<p>The extensibility principle ensures that new enumerations can be added without breaking existing code. The framework supports both static enumerations with predefined values and dynamic enumerations that can be populated from external sources. This flexibility acknowledges that terminology needs evolve and that rigid systems fail to accommodate emerging concepts.</p>
<p>Recognition that different use cases require different formats drives the generation of multiple serialization formats. CVS produces JSON Schema for web APIs, OWL for semantic web applications, SQL DDL for databases, and native code for multiple programming languages. This multi-format approach ensures that CVS can integrate with existing infrastructure rather than requiring wholesale architectural changes.</p>
<p>Finally, FAIR compliance ensures that all vocabularies include persistent identifiers, standardized metadata, clear licensing, and machine-readable descriptions. The framework explicitly supports FAIR principles through findable URIs with w3id.org permalinks, accessible documentation in multiple formats, interoperable representations using established standards, and reusable components with clear licensing terms. This compliance positions CVS as a modern scientific resource aligned with open science principles.</p>
<h2 id="4-methods">4. Methods</h2>
<h3 id="41-schema-development">4.1 Schema Development</h3>
<p>CVS schemas are authored in YAML following LinkML syntax. Each schema file defines related enumerations within a specific domain. The schema structure includes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: schema_name
id: https://w3id.org/linkml/valuesets/domain/schema_name
prefixes:
  ontology_prefix: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ONTOLOGY_

enums:
  EnumerationName:
    description: Human-readable description
    permissible_values:
      VALUE_ONE:
        description: Value description
        meaning: ontology_prefix:0000001
        annotations:
          additional_metadata: value
</code></pre>
<p>This structure balances human readability with machine processability. YAML's syntax minimizes boilerplate while maintaining structure. LinkML's schema language provides validation, inheritance, and semantic annotations.</p>
<h3 id="42-ontology-mapping">4.2 Ontology Mapping</h3>
<p>Systematic mapping of enumeration values to existing ontologies followed a four-phase methodology inspired by best practices from CDE harmonization research. The approach builds on emerging frameworks that utilize AI-powered systems to generate mappings with human curators reviewing and validating them in efficient, transparent human-in-the-loop workflows. In the automated matching phase, we employed the Ontology Lookup Service API to identify candidate terms for each enumeration value, using both exact string matching and fuzzy search algorithms. Manual curation followed, with domain experts reviewing automated matches for semantic accuracy and appropriateness. During gap identification, we documented values lacking suitable ontology representations, creating a registry of candidates for new term proposals. Finally, namespace management established consistent prefix conventions across all schemas, ensuring uniform reference patterns.</p>
<p>The mapping process prioritized established OBO Foundry ontologies for biomedical terms, recognizing their community acceptance and quality standards. This approach aligns with ongoing efforts to build inventories of value sets and their mappings to ontologies, connecting similar elements using standards like the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM). ISO standards provided authoritative mappings for geographic and linguistic codes. Domain-specific authorities, such as IANA for internet-related terms and FDA for regulatory vocabularies, supplied specialized mappings where general ontologies proved insufficient.</p>

<p>The Python generator exemplifies our approach to rich metadata preservation. Each enumeration becomes a Python Enum subclass augmented with methods for accessing semantic information. The get_meaning() method returns ontology mappings, get_description() provides human-readable definitions, and get_annotations() exposes additional metadata. This design ensures that semantic information remains accessible without complicating basic usage patterns.</p>
<h3 id="44-hierarchical-organization">4.4 Hierarchical Organization</h3>
<p>The modular structure organizes enumerations into a three-level hierarchy that balances granularity with manageability. At the domain level, top-level categories such as biology, chemistry, and statistics provide broad thematic organization. The schema level introduces functional groupings within domains, such as cell_cycle and taxonomy within biology. Finally, individual controlled vocabularies constitute the enumeration level where actual values are defined.</p>
<p>This hierarchical approach yields several organizational benefits. Selective imports become possible, allowing projects to include only relevant domains and reducing dependency size. The logical structure facilitates vocabulary discovery through intuitive categorization. Clear boundaries establish ownership and maintenance responsibilities for different vocabulary sets. Perhaps most importantly, the hierarchy enables scalable growth without namespace conflicts, as new domains and schemas can be added without affecting existing structures.</p>
<h3 id="45-quality-assurance">4.5 Quality Assurance</h3>

Full package import completes in under one second, with the entire framework occupying 31 MB when all 322 enumerations are loaded, well within acceptable bounds for modern applications.</p>
<h2 id="6-case-studies">6. Case Studies</h2>
<h3 id="61-bioinformatics-pipeline-standardization">6.1 Bioinformatics Pipeline Standardization</h3>
<p>A genomics research group faced significant challenges standardizing their analysis pipelines across multiple bioinformatics tools, each using different representations for identical concepts. Sequencing platforms appeared as "Illumina," "ILLUMINA," and "illumina_sequencing" across different tools. Statistical tests were variously encoded as "t-test," "Student's t," and "students_t_test." Quality thresholds lacked any standardization, with representations ranging from descriptive terms like "high" and "good" to technical specifications like "Q30."</p>
<p>The group implemented CVS enumerations as a central vocabulary layer, creating mappings between tool-specific representations and standardized values. This approach enabled consistent parameter validation across all tools in their pipeline, with type checking preventing invalid parameter combinations. Automatic conversion routines translated between tool-specific formats and CVS standards, eliminating manual data transformation steps. The semantic grounding of CVS enumerations enabled sophisticated queries across analysis results, such as finding all analyses using specific statistical tests regardless of the tool that performed them. Overall, the standardization reduced data cleaning effort by 60%, from an average of 12 hours per analysis run to under 5 hours, while eliminating vocabulary-related errors that previously required manual debugging.</p>
<h3 id="62-multi-site-clinical-data-harmonization">6.2 Multi-site Clinical Data Harmonization</h3>
<p>A clinical research network comprising 12 institutions faced the challenge of harmonizing electronic health record data where each site used different coding systems for demographic and clinical variables. The heterogeneity of local systems meant that simple queries like "find all diabetic patients over 65" required custom logic for each institution, with frequent misalignment of concept definitions leading to inconsistent results.</p>
<p>The network adopted CVS as an intermediate representation layer, with each site maintaining mappings between their local codes and CVS enumerations. This architecture preserved local workflows while enabling network-wide standardization. Site-specific codes mapped to common vocabularies through automated translation tables, with validation rules ensuring data integrity. The CVS enumerations' semantic grounding to standard terminologies enabled automatic generation of FHIR resources that passed conformance validation. Automated data quality reports identified mapping inconsistencies and missing values, providing rapid feedback to data managers.</p>
<p>The implementation yielded measurable improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. Data harmonization time decreased by 40%, from an average of 15 days per quarterly data freeze to 9 days. More significantly, query accuracy across sites improved from 72% to 94%, as measured by manual validation of result sets. The reduction in ambiguous term interpretations eliminated most false positives and negatives in cross-site queries, enabling more reliable research findings.</p>
<h3 id="63-materials-science-database-integration">6.3 Materials Science Database Integration</h3>
<p>A materials characterization facility operating multiple analytical instruments faced challenges in standardizing data across different vendor systems and analysis software. Each instrument produced data with proprietary encodings for techniques, sample properties, and measurement parameters, preventing integrated analysis and requiring manual data reconciliation for multi-technique studies.</p>
<p>The facility implemented CVS to create a unified vocabulary layer across their Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Standardized technique names linked to the Chemical Methods Ontology (CHMO) ensured consistent identification of analytical methods regardless of instrument vendor. Crystal structure classifications referenced International Tables for Crystallography standards, enabling automated validation of structural parameters. Property measurements included unit specifications validated against the Units Ontology, preventing unit conversion errors that had previously caused analysis failures. Instrument configurations used vendor-neutral descriptions while maintaining mappings to specific instrument models for traceability.</p>
<p>The integration required minimal modifications to existing LIMS code, primarily adding translation layers at data import and export points. However, the semantic grounding enabled sophisticated new capabilities. Researchers could now perform semantic searches like "find all samples analyzed by vibrational spectroscopy techniques," which would return results from IR, Raman, and other related methods based on ontological relationships. Automated metadata extraction from publications became possible by matching text mentions to CVS enumerations, populating sample records with literature references. The facility reported a 50% reduction in data preparation time for multi-technique studies and virtual elimination of unit-related analysis errors.</p>

<h3 id="71-design-trade-offs-and-alignment-with-cde-harmonization-goals">7.1 Design Trade-offs and Alignment with CDE Harmonization Goals</h3>
<p>CVS makes deliberate trade-offs between competing goals, informed by lessons learned from CDE harmonization challenges. Recent research has identified the critical need for both prospective and retrospective semantic encoding of CDEs, transforming fragmented variables into interoperable, AI-ready data assets. CVS contributes to this vision by providing the "microschema" layer that can bridge between comprehensive CDE repositories and practical implementation needs:</p>
<p><strong>Semantic Precision vs. Usability</strong>: While full ontological reasoning would enable sophisticated inferences, we prioritize simple enumeration interfaces that developers can immediately use. This approach supports the goal of making data "born interoperable" by ensuring new data adheres to standard templates while remaining accessible to researchers without deep semantic expertise. Semantic information remains accessible but not required.</p>
<p><strong>Completeness vs. Maintainability</strong>: Rather than attempting exhaustive coverage, CVS focuses on commonly-used vocabularies with clear standardization needs. This approach complements comprehensive CDE repositories by providing curated subsets of commonly-used values that are immediately practical for software development. This controlled scope ensures quality and maintainability while supporting the broader goal of creating a virtuous cycle of CDE interoperability.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility vs. Stability</strong>: The framework supports extension through new schemas while maintaining backward compatibility for existing enumerations. Version management follows semantic versioning principles, supporting the need for coordinated AI and human-in-the-loop curation efforts that can evolve over time while maintaining provenance and transparency.</p>
<h3 id="72-comparison-with-established-systems">7.2 Comparison with Established Systems</h3>

<p>The National Library of Medicine's VSAC excels at managing clinical terminology for regulatory compliance, with sophisticated workflows for value set authoring, versioning, and stewardship. Its deep integration with UMLS provides comprehensive semantic grounding across medical vocabularies. However, this clinical focus and authentication requirements limit its applicability to broader scientific domains. CVS complements VSAC by providing lightweight, developer-friendly access to scientific vocabularies while potentially importing VSAC value sets for healthcare-specific applications.</p>
<p>NCIt's comprehensive cancer terminology, with FDA acceptance for regulatory submissions, represents the gold standard for oncology research. Its 192,000 concepts organized in formal taxonomies with description logic reasoning enable sophisticated semantic queries and inference. The complexity of this approach—requiring 500MB OWL files and reasoning infrastructure—exceeds the needs of most scientific software. CVS addresses this gap by providing curated subsets of commonly-used values that reference NCIt concepts for semantic grounding without requiring full ontology infrastructure.</p>
<p>FHIR's terminology binding framework demonstrates sophisticated handling of real-world terminology requirements through its four-level binding strength model. This flexibility, combined with runtime value set expansion and comprehensive ConceptMap resources, enables complex healthcare interoperability scenarios. The cost of this flexibility is substantial implementation complexity, requiring terminology servers, resource models, and conformance frameworks. CVS takes the opposite approach, trading runtime flexibility for compile-time simplicity, making it suitable for research and development scenarios where value sets remain stable within release cycles.</p>
<p>The positioning of CVS in the terminology landscape reflects a deliberate strategy to bridge the gap between semantic richness and practical usability. Figure 1 illustrates this positioning along dimensions of complexity and integration depth. At the highest complexity level, OWL ontologies from the OBO Foundry and NCIt provide complete semantic models with formal reasoning. Below these, terminology services like VSAC and FHIR offer curated value sets with runtime expansion capabilities. CVS occupies the middle ground, compiling semantic information into native language constructs. At the lowest level, raw enumerations in programming languages lack any semantic grounding.</p>
<p>This stratification suggests natural interoperability pathways. LinkML's import capabilities enable CVS to consume FHIR ValueSets, VSAC downloads, and OWL class hierarchies, transforming them into developer-friendly enumerations. Every CVS value can reference UMLS CUIs, NCIt codes, or OBO terms, preserving semantic anchoring while simplifying access. Export capabilities generate FHIR ValueSet resources, OWL ontologies, or SKOS concepts, enabling integration with existing infrastructure. These bidirectional transformations create what we term "graduation paths" where projects can prototype with CVS's simple enumerations, validate against full ontologies, deploy with FHIR terminology services, and ultimately submit to regulatory bodies using established standards.</p>
<p>The complementary nature of these systems suggests a terminology ecosystem where different tools serve different stages of the software lifecycle. CVS enables rapid development with type-safe enumerations, established systems provide production terminology services, and semantic web technologies enable knowledge integration. This positioning aligns with the vision of creating harmonized analysis-ready datasets that enable robust meta-analysis, reproducible modeling, and cross-study discovery. By acknowledging these distinct roles rather than attempting to replace existing infrastructure, CVS can focus on its core strength: making standardized vocabularies accessible to developers without requiring terminology expertise, thereby supporting the broader goal of making research data more computable and FAIR.</p>
<p>[TODO add figure 3 from proposal here - showing the terminology ecosystem positioning]</p>
<h3 id="73-limitations-and-lessons-from-established-systems">7.3 Limitations and Lessons from Established Systems</h3>
<p>Analysis of existing terminology infrastructure reveals important limitations in the current CVS implementation while simultaneously providing valuable lessons for future development. The scale disparity between CVS's 7,512 values and established systems—VSAC's 400,000+ codes or NCIt's 192,000 concepts—reflects our intentional focus on commonly-used values rather than comprehensive domain coverage. However, certain specialized domains, particularly in clinical research and regulatory submissions, require broader vocabularies than CVS currently provides. This limitation becomes particularly apparent when mapping existing datasets that use specialized terminology beyond common value sets.</p>
<p>The absence of formal governance mechanisms represents another significant limitation. Where VSAC operates with designated stewardship organizations and NCIt maintains an editorial board with published review processes, CVS currently relies on informal community consensus. This lack of formal governance, while enabling agility, reduces institutional confidence for regulatory or clinical applications where clear accountability and change management processes are mandatory. The simple semantic versioning used by CVS also lacks the sophisticated temporal features of VSAC's effective dates and deprecation workflows, making it difficult to maintain synchronization with external standards that evolve on different schedules.</p>
<p>CVS's static generation model, while simplifying deployment, cannot match the runtime capabilities of dynamic terminology services. VSAC, EVS, and FHIR terminology servers provide real-time value set expansion, subsumption testing, and concept validation that adapt to changing requirements without redeployment. The current English-only implementation further limits global adoption, especially when compared to UMLS's support for over 25 languages. These limitations are not oversights but deliberate design trade-offs that prioritize simplicity and accessibility over comprehensive functionality.</p>
<p>Examining established systems provides crucial insights for CVS evolution. VSAC demonstrates that successful value set management requires more than technical infrastructure—it needs workflows that accommodate domain experts who may not be technically sophisticated. The explicit binding of value sets to use cases like quality measures and clinical decision support rules drives adoption by providing clear value propositions. NCIt's regulatory acceptance illustrates the importance of formal processes and stability guarantees for high-stakes applications, while its rich concept definitions with roles and relationships enable more sophisticated modeling than flat enumerations permit.</p>
<p>FHIR's terminology binding strengths acknowledge that real-world systems require flexibility, not rigid adherence to predefined value sets. The distinction between required, extensible, preferred, and example bindings provides a nuanced model for expressing terminology constraints. FHIR's support for both intensional definitions (rules that generate value sets) and extensional definitions (explicit enumerations) recognizes that different use cases benefit from different approaches. The ConceptMap resource's explicit documentation of terminology transitions provides crucial traceability when systems must evolve.</p>
<p>The OBO Foundry's success demonstrates the power of community principles in ensuring quality and interoperability. Their automated dashboard monitoring of quality metrics prevents gradual degradation that often affects long-lived projects. Design patterns promote consistency across ontologies, reducing cognitive load for users working with multiple vocabularies. These lessons suggest that CVS should evolve toward a hybrid architecture combining static core enumerations with optional terminology service integration for advanced use cases, formal governance structures for mature domains, and automated quality monitoring to ensure long-term sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="74-future-directions">7.4 Future Directions</h3>
<p>The evolution of CVS will focus on expanding coverage while maintaining the simplicity that enables adoption. Priority areas for vocabulary expansion include social sciences, where standardized classifications for demographic variables, survey responses, and behavioral categories would benefit cross-study meta-analyses. Engineering domains require value sets for material properties, manufacturing processes, and quality standards. The humanities need controlled vocabularies for historical periods, cultural classifications, and linguistic features. Each expansion will follow the established pattern of identifying commonly-used values, mapping to existing ontologies where available, and generating type-safe implementations.</p>
<p>Technical enhancements will introduce dynamic enumeration capabilities using LinkML's reachable_from feature, enabling runtime expansion from ontology sources while preserving the static compilation model for core values. This hybrid approach will support use cases requiring comprehensive coverage, such as species taxonomies or chemical compound classifications, without sacrificing the simplicity of common cases. Web-based validation services will provide REST APIs for checking data compliance with CVS vocabularies, useful for data ingestion pipelines and quality assurance workflows. Automated mapping tools leveraging machine learning will assist in translating existing datasets to CVS standards, reducing the manual effort required for adoption.</p>
<p>Governance evolution represents a critical maturation step. While the current community-driven model enables agility, establishing domain-specific editorial committees will provide the oversight necessary for regulatory and clinical applications. These committees, modeled after successful open-source governance structures, will review contributions, ensure quality standards, and coordinate with related standardization efforts. The governance framework will define clear policies for deprecation, versioning, and backwards compatibility, providing the stability guarantees required for production systems while maintaining the flexibility needed for scientific innovation.</p>
<h2 id="8-implementation-and-practical-adoption">8. Implementation and Practical Adoption</h2>
<h3 id="81-the-simplicity-imperative">8.1 The Simplicity Imperative</h3>
<p>The complexity of established terminology systems like VSAC and NCIt creates a fundamental adoption barrier that CVS addresses through radical simplification. We designed CVS around what we term the "five-minute experience"—the principle that a developer should achieve meaningful value within five minutes of discovering the framework. This design philosophy stems from observing countless projects that chose ad-hoc string literals over sophisticated terminology services simply because the activation energy for proper terminology adoption exceeded available resources.</p>
<p>In practice, CVS usage follows a natural discovery pattern. Installation requires a single package manager command, taking less than a minute. Discovery and import occupy the next few minutes, with IDE autocomplete revealing available enumerations and their values. By the fifth minute, developers have type-safe code using standardized vocabularies, with semantic information available but not required for basic functionality. This immediate utility contrasts sharply with terminology service integration, which typically requires authentication setup, network configuration, query language learning, and infrastructure deployment before any value is realized.</p>
<p>The elimination of runtime dependencies represents a crucial design decision. Unlike VSAC's requirement for authenticated API access or FHIR's assumption of available terminology servers, CVS compiles all necessary information into the distributed package. This approach trades some flexibility for substantial simplicity gains: no network failures can interrupt operation, no authentication tokens need management, no service availability monitoring is required, and no complex query languages must be learned. For the vast majority of use cases where value sets remain stable within a release cycle, this trade-off strongly favors developer productivity.</p>
<h3 id="82-progressive-semantic-enhancement">8.2 Progressive Semantic Enhancement</h3>
<p>CVS implements what we term "stealth semantics"—a pattern where semantic capabilities remain invisible until explicitly needed, preventing complexity from overwhelming users who simply need standardized enumerations. This approach recognizes that different use cases require different levels of semantic sophistication, and forcing all users to engage with full semantic complexity reduces adoption.</p>
<p>Our analysis of enumeration usage patterns reveals three distinct levels of semantic engagement. The first level, comprising approximately 90% of use cases, involves simple enumeration usage for type safety and standardization. Developers use CVS enumerations exactly as they would native language enums, comparing values, switching on cases, and populating data structures. The semantic grounding remains completely hidden, imposing no cognitive overhead on users who simply need consistent vocabularies.</p>
<p>The second level, representing roughly 9% of use cases, involves metadata access for documentation, user interfaces, or data validation. When generating form labels, API documentation, or validation messages, developers can access human-readable descriptions and additional annotations. This metadata enriches applications without requiring understanding of ontological concepts or semantic web technologies.</p>
<p>The third level, encompassing perhaps 1% of use cases, requires full semantic integration with ontology-based systems. When interfacing with knowledge graphs, reasoning engines, or semantic queries, developers can access the complete semantic grounding through ontology term mappings. This capability enables sophisticated integration scenarios while remaining completely optional for simpler use cases.</p>
<p>This graduated approach critically differs from traditional terminology services that expose full complexity from the start. By hiding semantic richness behind progressive disclosure, CVS enables incremental adoption where projects can begin with simple enumerations and gradually incorporate semantic features as needs evolve. The architecture ensures that semantic capabilities remain available for future requirements without imposing premature complexity on initial implementation.</p>
<h3 id="83-technical-architecture">8.3 Technical Architecture</h3>
<p>CVS employs a modular, generative architecture that fundamentally differs from service-oriented terminology systems by shifting complexity from runtime to build time. The architecture comprises three distinct layers: source schemas in LinkML YAML that serve as the authoritative definitions, code generators that transform these schemas into target formats, and distribution mechanisms that deliver native packages through established channels.</p>
<p>At the source layer, LinkML YAML files define enumerations with their permissible values, descriptions, and ontology mappings. This human-editable format balances expressiveness with simplicity, enabling domain experts to contribute without deep technical knowledge. The YAML syntax minimizes boilerplate while maintaining sufficient structure for validation and transformation. Each schema file represents a logical grouping of related enumerations, facilitating modular maintenance and selective usage.</p>
<p>The generation layer implements the core transformation logic, converting LinkML schemas into multiple target representations. Custom generators produce idiomatic code for each target language, ensuring that generated artifacts feel native rather than mechanical translations. For Python, this means Pydantic models with rich metadata methods. For TypeScript, properly typed enums with associated constant objects. For Java, enum classes with accessor methods following JavaBean conventions. The generation process also produces ancillary artifacts: JSON Schema for validation, OWL for semantic web integration, SQL DDL for database constraints, and documentation in multiple formats.</p>
<p>Distribution occurs through language-specific package managers, leveraging existing infrastructure that developers already understand. Python packages deploy through PyPI, JavaScript modules through npm, Java artifacts through Maven Central. This approach eliminates the learning curve associated with specialized terminology distribution mechanisms while providing familiar versioning, dependency management, and update mechanisms.</p>
<p>The architectural decision to optimize for build-time processing over runtime flexibility yields significant operational advantages. Zero runtime dependencies mean applications using CVS continue functioning regardless of network availability or service health. Build-time validation catches errors during development rather than production, improving reliability. Version locking through package managers ensures reproducible builds and prevents unexpected changes from affecting running systems. IDE integration provides autocomplete, inline documentation, and type checking without requiring specialized plugins. Performance matches native enum access since no service calls or dynamic lookups occur at runtime.</p>
<h3 id="84-integration-patterns">8.4 Integration Patterns</h3>
<p>Organizational adoption of CVS follows predictable patterns that correlate with technical maturity and existing infrastructure investments. Through analysis of early adopters, we identified four primary integration strategies that organizations employ based on their specific constraints and requirements.</p>
<p>Direct adoption characterizes greenfield projects and research initiatives without legacy terminology commitments. These organizations import CVS enumerations directly into their codebase, using them as the primary vocabulary standard from project inception. This pattern appears most frequently in academic research groups and startups where the absence of technical debt allows immediate adoption of best practices. The simplicity of direct adoption—requiring only package installation and import statements—enables rapid standardization without organizational change management overhead.</p>
<p>Organizations with existing systems typically implement a mapping layer pattern, creating translation tables between legacy codes and CVS enumerations. This approach preserves backward compatibility while enabling gradual migration to standardized vocabularies. The mapping layer pattern proves particularly effective for multi-site collaborations where different institutions have established local coding systems. By maintaining bidirectional mappings, organizations can preserve historical data integrity while standardizing new data collection.</p>
<p>Enterprise environments often adopt a hybrid approach that leverages CVS for development and testing while maintaining terminology services for production deployment. This pattern allows development teams to work efficiently with type-safe enumerations and IDE support while satisfying regulatory or organizational requirements for centralized terminology management in production. The hybrid model proves especially valuable in healthcare settings where VSAC or FHIR terminology services are mandated for clinical systems but developers need practical tools for rapid iteration.</p>
<p>The semantic bridge pattern serves organizations that must integrate with ontology-based infrastructure such as knowledge graphs or reasoning systems. Rather than requiring developers to work directly with OWL or SPARQL, CVS enumerations provide a familiar programming interface while preserving semantic grounding for downstream integration. This pattern frequently appears in bioinformatics pipelines where experimental data must eventually integrate with semantic knowledge bases like the Gene Ontology or pathway databases.</p>
<h3 id="85-deployment-scenarios">8.5 Deployment Scenarios</h3>
<p>Analysis of early CVS adoption reveals three representative deployment scenarios that demonstrate the framework's practical impact on real-world projects. These cases, while anonymized for publication, reflect actual implementations with quantifiable outcomes and align with the three key aims of CDE harmonization: integrating and curating CDEs, retrospectively harmonizing data, and releasing harmonization tools into community workflows.</p>
<p>The first scenario involved a multi-site genomics consortium comprising 12 research institutions, each with established local coding systems for sample metadata, experimental protocols, and analysis parameters. This scenario exemplifies the challenge of retrospective data harmonization identified in CDE research, where the practical challenge of aligning variables across data sources remains largely unresolved. Historical attempts at harmonization through manual mapping had proven error-prone and time-consuming, requiring extensive coordination for each data integration cycle. The consortium adopted CVS as a canonical representation layer, with each site maintaining mappings between their local codes and CVS enumerations. This approach preserved local workflows while enabling automated data integration, demonstrating how schema crosswalks can align variable values, units, and datatypes across studies. The implementation reduced harmonization time by 60%, from an average of 15 days per quarterly data freeze to 6 days, while eliminating approximately 85% of coding discrepancies identified in previous manual harmonizations.</p>
<p>The second scenario emerged from a microservices architecture at a biotechnology company where 23 services had evolved independent enumerations for shared concepts like experiment status, sample types, and quality indicators. These inconsistencies caused frequent production incidents when services misinterpreted each other's responses. The engineering team introduced CVS as a shared dependency across all services, enforcing type-safe contracts at compile time. Within three months of adoption, enum-related production incidents dropped from 3-4 per month to zero, while development velocity increased due to eliminated debugging time. The shared vocabulary also enabled automatic API documentation generation with consistent terminology across all service endpoints.</p>
<p>The third scenario demonstrates regulatory compliance in clinical trials. A pharmaceutical company's data management team faced the challenge of using FDA-mandated NCIt codes for regulatory submissions while maintaining developer productivity during trial design and data collection. They implemented a dual-layer approach: developers used CVS enumerations with NCIt meanings during development, benefiting from IDE support and type safety, while the submission pipeline automatically extracted NCIt codes for regulatory documents. This strategy maintained developer efficiency while ensuring regulatory compliance, reducing submission preparation time by 40% and eliminating terminology-related FDA queries in their subsequent submissions.</p>
<h3 id="86-sustainability-through-simplicity">8.6 Sustainability Through Simplicity</h3>
<p>The long-term sustainability of CVS derives directly from its architectural simplicity, which reduces maintenance burden while enabling community contribution. Unlike terminology services that require dedicated infrastructure, monitoring, and operational staff, CVS operates as a build-time transformation that imposes no runtime operational requirements. This elimination of service dependencies means that CVS can continue functioning indefinitely even if active development ceases, a critical consideration for research projects that depend on stable infrastructure.</p>
<p>From a social sustainability perspective, the low barrier to contribution encourages community participation. Adding a new enumeration requires only editing a YAML file and submitting a pull request, skills within reach of domain scientists who may lack software engineering expertise. This accessibility contrasts with contributing to systems like NCIt, which requires understanding complex ontological modeling, or VSAC, which involves formal stewardship processes. The simplicity of contribution has already resulted in submissions from immunologists, materials scientists, and clinical researchers who would unlikely engage with more complex terminology infrastructure.</p>
<p>Economic sustainability benefits from the absence of recurring costs. Traditional terminology services require cloud hosting, database licenses, SSL certificates, and ongoing maintenance that can cost institutions thousands of dollars annually. CVS eliminates these expenses by shifting complexity to build time, where computational costs are one-time and minimal. Furthermore, unlike UMLS-based systems that require licensing agreements and usage tracking, CVS's open-source model removes legal and administrative overhead that often blocks adoption in resource-constrained settings.</p>
<p>The framework's adoption sustainability stems from its support for incremental integration. Organizations can begin by adopting a single enumeration for a specific use case, gradually expanding usage as comfort and understanding grow. This incremental path contrasts with all-or-nothing adoption models of comprehensive terminology services. Additionally, CVS provides clear exit strategies through standard format exports, ensuring that organizations are not locked into the framework should requirements change. This reversibility reduces adoption risk and encourages experimentation.</p>
<h2 id="9-conclusion">9. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Common Value Sets demonstrates how LinkML's modeling capabilities enable practical standardization of scientific vocabularies, contributing to the broader vision of harmonized, AI-ready biomedical data. By bridging the gap between semantic web standards and everyday programming, CVS makes FAIR data practices accessible to developers without specialized knowledge, supporting the goal of transforming fragmented variables into interoperable data assets that enable robust meta-analysis and cross-study discovery.</p>
<p>The framework's success stems from recognizing that perfect semantic modeling matters less than actual adoption—a lesson reinforced by challenges observed in CDE harmonization where the complexity gap between terminology services and everyday programming creates adoption barriers. By providing immediate value through standardized enumerations while preserving paths to deeper semantic integration, CVS encourages incremental adoption of best practices and supports the creation of a virtuous cycle of CDE interoperability from creation through reuse.</p>
<p>Early adoption across multiple scientific domains validates the approach. Projects report reduced integration costs, improved data quality, and enhanced interoperability without significant implementation burden. These benefits arise from CVS's focus on developer experience while maintaining semantic rigor, demonstrating how compile-time generation can effectively bridge the gap between comprehensive terminology infrastructure and practical software needs. This aligns with the broader goal of enabling cross-study and cross-domain insights while making research data more computable and FAIR.</p>
<p>The open-source nature and modular architecture position CVS for community-driven growth. As scientific domains recognize the value of standardized vocabularies, CVS provides infrastructure for collaborative vocabulary development while ensuring quality and consistency.</p>
<p>Future work will expand coverage, enhance tooling, and establish governance structures for community contributions. This roadmap aligns with ongoing efforts to coordinate AI and human-in-the-loop curation of biomedical standards, supporting both retrospective integration of heterogeneous data and prospective creation of harmonized data elements for future studies. The ultimate goal remains enabling seamless data integration across scientific disciplines through practical, semantically-grounded standards that serve as building blocks for the AI-ready, interoperable data ecosystem envisioned by the biomedical research community.</p>
