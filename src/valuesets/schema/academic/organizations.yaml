  ## Guidelines for Organization Identifiers

  When mapping organization names to ontology terms, **use ROR (Research Organization Registry) as the primary source**.
  ROR provides persistent identifiers for research organizations worldwide and is the preferred standard
  for identifying research institutions.

  - ROR Homepage: https://ror.org/
  - ROR Search: https://ror.org/search
  - ROR API: https://api.ror.org/organizations

  ROR IDs should be used in the `meaning` field with the full URL format (e.g., https://ror.org/05gvnxz63).
